### Restructure OOP lectures

The current order seems to difficult. 
IMHO it will be better to start OOP in the following sequence:

1. Static Methods and reusable code
2. Classes & Properties
3. Classes & Methods
4. Classes & Constructors
5. Access Modifiers and etc...

### Separate Solutions that are present in Exercises

It seems that when the students have the solutions in place 
they do not think that hard how to write a peace of code.

It would be better to have first the Tasks and at the end of the lecture
to have the solutions

Example:

```
- Tasks
    - task 1
    - task 2
    - task 3

- Solutions
    - solution 1
    - solution 2
    - solution 3
```    


### Generic things to improve

- [ ] Add missing shortcuts in previous lectures
- [ ] Add table of contents in each lecture
- [ ] Add additional reading materials in each lecture and videos
- [ ] Restructure curse content and separate Collections if applicable into several lectures


### Lecture 5

- [ ] Homework solutions for `Task 1.4` on matrixes


### Lecture 7

- [ ] Add homework solutions for tasks


### Lecture 12

- [ ] `Task 4` needs more clarification
    - [ ] add solutions for sub-tasks `3`, `4` and `5`


### Lecture 14

- [ ] Explain Buffered Writing/Reading
- [ ] Explain Serializable
- [ ] Examples for Reading files
- [ ] ObjectSerializer explained with examples
- [ ] Solutions for all tasks


### Lecture 15 Generics 

- [ ] tasks 
- [ ] further theory 
- [ ] lower bound super keyword
- [ ] multiple generic parameters
- [ ] difference between generic method and generic class
