### Restructure OOP lectures

The current order seems to difficult. 
IMHO it will be better to start OOP in the following sequence:

1. Static Methods and reusable code
2. Classes & Properties
3. Classes & Methods
4. Classes & Constructors
5. Access Modifiers and etc...


### Separate Solutions that are present in Exercises

It seems that when the students have the solutions in place 
they do not think that hard how to write a peace of code.

It would be better to have first the Tasks and at the end of the lecture
to have the solutions

Example: 
- Tasks
    - task 1
    - task 2
    - task 3

- Solutions
    - solution 1
    - solution 2
    - solution 3
